EE_Relative_URL
============

ExpressionEngine wants every website on a single environment, tied to a single web address, and with every URL an absolute URL. Developers attempting to manage multiple environments often find themselves scouring the 80+ tables that make up ExpressionEngine's database for uncaught instances of the last-managed environment's web address. While utilities exist to ease the work of migrating an EE database across servers, few if any provide a simple means to address server setups of any complexity in the templates.

Relative_URL is an ExpressionEngine plugin that brings a blunt regular expression to EE's generated URLs, stripping them to a spare `/`.

## Installation

Move or copy the `relative_url` directory to `system/expressionengine/third_party/`.

## Usage

| in the template                                                       | plausible output   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `{exp:relative_url}http://example.com/foo/bar{/exp:relative_url}`     | `/foo/bar`         |
| `{exp:relative_url}{url_title_path='blog/index'}/{/exp:relative_url}` | `/blog/category/8` |
| `{exp:relative_url}{url}{/exp:relative_url}`                          | `/images/sharing/dwi.gif`  |
